      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				[No, they all cannot be constants. Constants should be used as values that cannot be changed. This means that variables ike "let" and "var" could have variable value, and be used when the value is undeclared.]
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				[A parantheses will affect the arithmetic value of an expression by declaring the value of whats inside the decimal first. This means that the value of the decimal will be determend before the rest of the syntax.]
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				[We can juse the To.Fixed() Method, to reduce the floating-point numbers to a given decimals.]
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				[How we could check if the floating-point numbers are equal depends on if they are to be use strict with all decimals given. If the decimals are not important we could use the == syntax to check. but if the decimals are to be use strict, be would need to run an (epsilon) math.abs(a-b) to determine the equality of the two numbers. Usually they will be consitered equal, but that depends on the accuracy of the programe used. ]
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				[Comparison operators often return the Boolean value, weather they are true or false. This value indicates wheather its valid or not. We could use syntaxes like "===","==", "<", "!=" and other to check for false and true value.]
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				[Math.random() can be used to calculate a number between a set number to create a value. This could example be used when picking a winner in a lottery.]
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				[Modulus (%) is used to return the remaining values after dividing the value givven. ex: 7 % 2 -> 1, bacause 7 cannot be divided by 2 without being decimal. ]
