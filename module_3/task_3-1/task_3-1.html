      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[If you wake up at 6 or 8, you cannot take the bus. If you wake up at 7, you can take the bus.]</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[If you wake up a 7, you can take the bus to school. If you wake up at 6 or 8 you would take the car to school.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[If you wake up less or more than 7, and 8, you take the car to school.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p> If you get 0, this will qualify as zero. Eighter positive nor negative.</p>
