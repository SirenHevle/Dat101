      <li>[1. Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?]</li>
      <p>[object oriantated development is important to allow developers to break down complex problems into smaller and more manageble classes and objects.]</p>

      <li>[2. In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
        how this type of object can help us in software development.]</li>
      <p>[this object is used to store and define constants or identifiers for various types of accounts.]</p>

      <li>[3. Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.]</li>
      <p>[we use encapsulation to secure that secret info stays private and protected and not in public for everyone to see. We do it so that hidden parts could be done only through controlled and well-defined interfaces, which allows for validation vefore change.]</p>

      <li>[4. Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript]</li>
      <p>["new" is used to change object. This way you could switch from f.eks. Kari and Tores accounts without them joining in to eachother.]</p>
