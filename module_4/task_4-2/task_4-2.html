      <li>[1. What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!]</li>
      <p>[Array is a list where you could f.eks have name, dates or birds. ]</p>

      <li>[2. What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
        coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").]</li>
      <p>[When we hard code we embead specific or fixed values directly in to the code. Insted of using variables and configurations. This could limit flexibility but you could code faster. ]</p>

      <li>[3. Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
        (humans) don't "know" how long the array is]</li>
      <p>[In task 3, we are working on arrays and preforming some operations on it. Heres what typically happens when we the lenght is not know. ---###. ]</p>

      <li>[4. Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?]</li>
      <p>[It is benefitial to store instances in class of array to have a structured and easy code. This will also help when managing and accessing them.]</p>

      <li>[5. Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
        example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
        wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
        "Thursday", how would it ideally look? (I will choose the best answer to this task and reward it with
        pizza in the cafeteria right after New Year. Remember to mark in your submission if you want to
        participate in the competition!)]</li>
      <p>[I want to participate in the comppetition!! We cretate different codes to define what days that has the same amount of value, and stores them in right order. We will then know what each day has as a value and how many days has the same. grouping them togheter we could easily compare them and their value, while still having them seperated in to different cathegories depending on what they are set to assign. If we where to create a workout day as hexidecimals, it would look something like this: 0001101. Monday, wednesday and thursday is set as workout days. ]</p>

      <li>[6. In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works]</li>
      <p>[The callBack function takes elements from the array as input. It then returns a value to indicate a reliative order of the elemnts such as - a negative value - zero in or positive value. ]</p>

      <li>[7. What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out
        if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
        both parameters each time the sorting routine runs]</li>
      <p>[Write your answer here, and copy this for more answers]</p>

      <li>[8. In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array
        contains]</li>
      <p>[The first elements is rows.]</p>
